## ‚ú® About The Project

Day Finder is more than just a date calculator. It's a carefully crafted PWA built with vanilla technologies to ensure maximum performance and accessibility. The core logic handles the complex historical shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in October 1582, correctly identifying the 10 days that were skipped.

This project was built to demonstrate a practical application of a classic algorithm in a modern, user-friendly, and installable web app.

### Key Features:

*   **Accurate Algorithm:** Implements Zeller's Congruence for precise day-of-the-week calculations.
    
*   **Historical Accuracy:** Correctly handles the 10-day gap (Oct 5‚Äì14, 1582) during the Gregorian calendar reform.
    
*   **Installable PWA:** Works offline and can be installed on mobile or desktop devices for a native-app experience.
    
*   **Fully Responsive:** A clean, mobile-first design that looks and works great on any screen size.
    
*   **Highly Optimized:** Built with Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS for lightning-fast load times.

*   **Multi-lingual:** World top 10 languages switchable.
    
*   **SEO-Friendly:** Includes structured data (JSON-LD) and comprehensive meta tags for high visibility on search engines.
